```typescript
// JavaScript goes here,
// And will be syntax-highlighted!
const a: string = 'disco';
```

## Lists

For lists, we have both `ul` and `ol` to account for, and both of them use li. For the ul and old, I like to use list-inside or list-outside depending on the design, for this demo I used the former.

For li we have to set the color (which would be the same as the p, to maintain consistency) but we can also set the color of the bullets (for uls) and the numbers (for ols). To achieve this, we can use the :marker pseudo class, the ending result would be prose-li:marker:text-emerald-700.
